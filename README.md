Instructions to use the program.
This is a program that is executed in the command prompt. The first step to use the program is to fill in the URL, USERNAME and PASSWORD
fields in the User class. After that you may compile and run the program (make sure that mysql-connector is in the class path). The program
will prompt you to enter the category of the furniture to be built, here you may enter chair, desk, lamp and filing, capitalization does not
matter. After the program will prompt the type of furniture to be entered, make sure that the type of furnture exists in the database before
entering the input. Finally the program will prompt you to enter the amount of furniture you would like to make. If the order can be fufilled
the program will output the items used to build the peice, the price and an order form will generate in a directory called Orders in you package
folder. If it cannot be made a list of possible manufactuerers will be outputed. If any input cannot be found in the database the program will
tell you that it has encountered an error and at that point you will have to execute the program again.

NOTE: If you like to run any of the unit tests please update their URL, USERNAME, and PASSWORD as well.
